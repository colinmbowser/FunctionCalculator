# Overview

My friend has been having some troubles with his calculus homework so I tried to make a program that would help him confirm the answers so that he was able to learn better. Haskell is an interesting language.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to write this program with the haskell plug ins. I rant he function through ghci.
