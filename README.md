# Overview

My friend has been having some troubles with his calculus homework so I tried to make a program that would help him confirm the answers so that he was able to learn better. Haskell is an interesting language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to write this program with the haskell plug ins. I rant he function through ghci.
